<h1>gakuhub</h1><div class="body"><p>gakuhub is a personal side project that I started aimed to provide a platform for internationals students within Japan to connect with each other. When I first started looking into completing my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Japan, I found that there was a lack of first-hand resource available for me to consult with and see if is was for me. Even after getting to university in Japan, I found that there was little infrastructure available to connect the international students of different year groups.</p><p>I want this service to become a gateway for prospective students to obtain information and consult with current students on their experiences. Even after arriving in Japan, provide a platform to which anyone may seek help whether to setup everything they need, deal with the language barrier most encounter on arrival or simply to find new people and have a community to connect with.</p><p>The frameworks used for this project are:</p><ul><li>Front-end: Node.js with Vue CLI - webpack</li><li>Back-end: Loopback (Node.js) Express Server</li><li>Database: MongoDB</li></ul></div>
