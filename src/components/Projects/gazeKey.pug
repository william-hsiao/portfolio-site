  p The ability to input text in an electronic device is one of the most powerful interaction methods available to a user. While traditional keyboards have asserted themselves as the primary hands-on input method on almost all commercial computer systems, there is yet to be an outstanding method for hands-free input, more specifically in the field utilizing eye tracking. There has been a lot of research within this field, most notably in assisting individuals with disabilities, and has improved with alongside the advancement of eye tracking technology. As we head more towards the world of filled with Virtual Reality (VR) or perhaps more notably, Artificial Reality (AR), an efficient hands-free system of text input becomes ever so important to further unlock potential interactions using these technologies.

  p In this research, I aim to create an input system using pure eye tracking that is easy and efficient to use within the graphical interface provided by a head mounted displays (HMD). The main scenario this research is based upon is the use within a head-up display (HUD) from a device such as glasses, that is connected with a smartphone to provide basic notification and interactions without physically interacting with the smartphone itself. There is not expectation for such a method to rival traditional keyboards but has the goal to allow simple interactions such as text messaging or inputting keywords for a search.
