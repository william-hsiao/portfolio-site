        h1 About
        p I am an aspiring full-stack developer currently based in Tokyo. Although my work so far has mostly been around web development, I am always eager to venture into new fields and face new challenges. I believe that to create the best applications, one must have a solid understanding of all components not only on the technical aspects but also how each component contributes to the greater purpose of the project. It is with this mindset that I step into projects and aim to learn as much as I can from each experience. Even if itâ€™s something I am already familiar with, there is always more to gain, more to discover, more to improve upon.
        i "Jack of all trades, but master of none"
        p is a phrase that is quite befitting of me yet one that I despise. Although I always strive to be an all-rounder in the fields I commit to in order to open the doors to as many opportunities possible, I cannot say that I am satisfied with where I am now. There is always more to learn and that is what drives me to keep improving myself everyday, constantly chasing to be the best that I can be.
        p I want to challenge the world.
        p I want to develop a product that changes lives.
        p I want to meet and work with like-minded people and see how far we can go.
